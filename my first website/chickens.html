        <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated red junglefowl
            species that are originally from Southeast Asia. They have also partially hybridized
            with other wild species of junglefowls (the grey <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a> , Ceylon junglefowl, and
            green junglefowl).<sup><a href="http://www.google.com">[1]</a></sup> Rooster and cock are terms for
            adult male
            birds, and a younger
            male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult
            female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
            Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat
            and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which
            is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers
            and for eggs are layers.Chickens are one of the most common and widespread
            domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, <sup>[2]</sup> up from
            more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other
            bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore and religion,
            and in language and literature.

        <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia,
            Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe,
            the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India,
            the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the
            mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the
            land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose
            III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th century BC.[7][8]
